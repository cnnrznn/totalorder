ARCHITECTURE
        `main.c` is meant to act as a client to the multicast service.
        The main body of the service is implemented in `channel.c`.

        The channel has four main interface functions:
        * ch_init() - initialize socket, datastructures
        * ch_fini() - cleanup
        * ch_send(int) - multicast an int
        * ch_recv(int*) - attempt to receive(deliver) a message from the channel

        `queue.*` is a generic queue implementation with sorting and searching
