ARCHITECTURE
        `main.c` is meant to act as a client to the multicast service.
        The main body of the service is implemented in `channel.c`.

        The channel has four main interface functions:
        * ch_init() - initialize socket, datastructures
        * ch_fini() - cleanup
        * ch_send(int) - multicast an int
        * ch_recv(int*) - attempt to receive(deliver) a message from the channel

        `queue.*` is a generic queue implementation with sorting and searching

DEBUGGING
	When moving to four nodes, I noticed that initially the messages were sent quickly, but would slow over time.
	Initially I thought this was a symptom of the back-off congestion control.
	After reducing the back-off rate to 1.1, the problem persisted.
	I employed gprof.
	My guess was that frequent invocations of a quicksort function that didn't check for the sorted property were to blame.
	I was correct, and the gprof file can be found in `debugging/sorting.gprof`.
