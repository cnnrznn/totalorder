EXTRAS:
        1. put channel on separate thread
                - don't disturb application execution by blocking
        2. consider invasion
                - ignore packets from outsiders

EVALUATION:
        Hyper-parameters:
                * default timeout
                * timeout factor
                * timeout bound

        For a closed, 4 node system, how do each of these parameters effect the total number of messages sent, including re-transmissions?
